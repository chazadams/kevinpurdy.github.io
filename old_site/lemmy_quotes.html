	<h2><font face="verdana, helvetica">Lemmy: The Most Quotable Bastard in Rock n' Roll</font></h2>
	<p>Lemmy Kilmister: Bassist. Leader of the inimitable, unconquerable, hard-as-nails entity known as Motörhead. Living icon of what rock once was, what it always should be, and how, most likely, it will never be again - loud, fast, out of control.</p>
	<p>Without reading or hearing anything about the man or the band, without even listening to the songs themselves, you'd know the man's basic philosophy just by thumbing through any good record store's "M" section.</p>
	<p>"Overkill." "No Remorse." "No Sleep At All." "Everything Louder Than Everyone Else." And, to put it simply, "Rock N' Roll."</p>
	<p>Prominently displayed in dozens of liner notes, printed in hundreds of articles, repeated eagerly by countless devoted fans, Lemmy's quotes and anecdotes are the stuff of legend. Like his songs, they're often plain-spoken, direct and powerful. Like the man himself, sometimes they're rude, humorous and over-the-top.</p>
	<p>But they're always original, and often worth repeating.</p>
	<p>Here I've created what I hope will become a semi-definitive compendium of quotes from Lemmy. I'll be tinkering with organization quite a bit, and working to find the original attributions to replace lifts from CD booklets, but hopefully it can be of use to fans and curious searchers alike.</p>
	<p>If you have any additional quotes or suggestions, feel free to e-mail me at kevin-nospam-@-nospam-thepurdman.com (obviously, remove the "-nospam-" tags from the address before sending). If sending a quote, please send along the source, a date if possible, and, if it's from another site or written source, the proper attribution.</p>
	<p>Enjoy ~ The Purdman</p>

	<p><h3>On His Band</h3></p>
	<ul>
	<li><p>"We're the kind of band that if we moved in next to you, your lawn would die" <em>~ many, many different attributions (and wordings)</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"I'm going to start a band of my own and I'm going to call it Bastard!" <em>~ said to his flat-mate in London, Motorcycle Irene, immediately after being kicked out of Hawkwind in 1975. Quoted in Houston Chronicle, Oct. 26, 1986.</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"(The English) like us all right. We're kind of like the old chap who lives upstairs and they bring us down now and then and give us a cup of tea and send us back upstairs again. Trouble is, this old chap brings a knife down with him." <em>~ Boston Globe, Nov. 4 1988</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"I am in this band for one reason, and that is because it's fun ... That is all that rock 'n' roll is supposed to be -- pure joy." <em>~ Washington Times, Aug. 15 1991</em></p></li>
	</ul>

	<p><h3>On Rock</h3></p>
	<ul>
	<li><p>"Rock n' Roll is not a job, it is a life. If you break your leg under a bus and lose it you don't just shoot yourself because you've lost your leg, you have to make do with one leg and get a plastic one. You survive. And the name of the game is survival. I'll survive through bad P.A.s, I'll survive through my bass giving out, I'll survive through anything." <em>~ "Ace of Spades" CD booklet</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"There's not much else I can do. I wouldn't have minded being a rancher or something, 'cause I can ride horses. That's what I was gonna do when I first started; I was gonna be a horse breeder." <em>~ Boston Globe, Nov. 4, 1988</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"Rock and roll is supposed to be loud. And also, in some deep way which I don't quite understand, it's supposed to be offensive to people who don't like it too loud." <em>~ Austin American-Statesman, Aug. 19 1991</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"What's the use of going out there if people can still hear after you're done?" <em>~ Orange County Register, Aug. 19, 1991</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"Let's have more volume, we want this to hurt." <em>~ Onstage at the CNE Coliseum, as quoted in The Globe and Mail, May 14, 1982.</em></p></li>
	</ul>

	<p><h3>On Life</h3></p>
	<ul>
	<li><p>"Born To Lose, Live To Win" <em>~ Tattoo on Lemmy's forearm</em></p>
	<li><p>"Safe sex, safe music, safe clothing, safe hair spray, safe ozone layer. Too late! Everything that's been achieved in the history of mankind has been achieved by not being safe ..." <em>~ "Overkill" CD booklet</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"Do you remember the rumor about Keith Richards getting his blood changed? I thought it'd be a good idea because speed is habit-forming and I'd been doing it and drinking for over 20 years. If you have your blood changed, I'd suppose that there's nothing in it and that it's clean -- maybe like when I was a kid. Once the doctor saw what I'd done and the hours I keep he told me to forget it: "Pure blood will probably kill ya!" <em>~ "Ace of Spades" CD booklet</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"This bus is now where I live. My life is over as far as sitting down to dinner with a few friends goes -- you can forget me. I am a road clone. I love sitting in that front seat and watching the sun come up." <em>~ "Ace of Spades" CD booklet</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"I'm just not a country-mansion person -- know what I mean?" <em>~ Sun Herald, Jan. 1, 1989</em></p></li>
	</ul>

	<p><h3>On Love</h3></p>
	<ul>
	<li><p>"Chin up, shoulders back / You've got a body like a Marshall stack" <em>~ From "Dr. Rock," Orgasmatron</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"Hash browns an' bacon strips / I love the way that you lick your lips" <em>~ From "Eat the Rich"</em></p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><h3>From Lyrics</h3></p>
	<ul>	
	<li><p>"Only way to feel the noise is when it's good and loud" <em>~ "Overkill," Overkill, 1979</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools, but that's the way I like it baby, I don't wanna live forever," <em>~ "Ace of Spades," Ace of Spades, 1980</em></p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><h3>On Other Musicians</h3></p>
	<ul>
	<li><p>"Golf. I hate golf! I still can't believe Alice Cooper plays golf!" <em>~ The Independent (London), date unknown</em></p></li>
	<li><p>"I always associated hard rock with the MC5 thing, while heavy metal sounded like a geezer plodding along with lead in his driver boots." <em>~ "Ace of Spades" CD booklet</em></p></li>

	</ul>

	<p><h3>On ... Whatever</h3></p>
	<ul>
	<li><p>"Hitler was a vegetarian, didn't smoke or drink -- a perfect guy for the '90s." <em>~ Newsweek, August 1991</em></p></li>
	<li><p><em>On his cure for hangovers:</em> 1) The natural way: Suffer ... 2) The chemical way: Take all the painkillers in the house. Lie very still, so as not to disturb the painkillers. <em>~ Details, August 1993</em></p></li>
