	<p><a href="http://www.davesditches.com">Dave's Ditches</a></p>
	<p>The man who made this site possible, David Meehan. Leader of the new Web design school termed "Button Mania" by -- well, by me.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.orangewarp.net">Orangewarp.net</a></p>
	<p>Jin Kuwata, the Baltimore-area's lady-killer. Seriously, the dude is hardcore about Akido.  But also really, really sensitive.  So, you ladies should look him up. <i>(Note: Doesn't actually murder females)</i></p>
	<p><a href="http://incoherentideas.net">Incoherent Ideas Inc.</a></p>
	<p>The musings and photos and roller coasters of Aaron Richardson. Formerly my drinking coach and tech support guru; now derives the occasional grin from hearing of my latest stupid move.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/~emf2/">Lizzie Web</a></p>
	<p>My one and only, my constant companion, my Champion of Social Justice, my Little Never-Ending Well of Hunger, Elizabeth Fox-Solomon. Disclaimer: She hasn't touched this site since her Freshman year at UB, when it was built for UB's prestigious, exclusive Honors program. But she promises to bring more Social Justice to the Web when she gets a break from law school. Which is never.</p>

	<p>Besides my family, this guy has known The Purdman longer than anybody on earth. Yet he still manages to graduate RIT and begin a career in video game creation. He's so hardcore, he doesn't have time to generate a silly name for his Web site. Crazy, man. Crazy.
	<p><strong>New ~ </strong><a href="w00tz/index.html">w00tz</a></p>
	<p>On one hand, it's like Krusty the Klown said about Sideshow Rahim: "Angry, angry young man." On the other, he's so intense about things, he'll blow your mind out your ears. In a good way.
	<p><a href="http://manijak.net">Manijak.net</a></p>
	<p>Follow the travails of former Spectrum copy editor and full-time Witty Guy Phil Manijak, as he braves a trail across the Northwest. He dispenses great financial advice, by the way, and will one day be able to power-lift an F-350.<br><font size="1"><em>Note: The preceding statement contains forward-looking information within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is subject to the safe harbor created by those Sections.</em></font></p>

	<p>Unfiltered Nick Farnolo, in blog form. The only kid I know who can bust the James Joyce as easily as the Wu-Tang, and who once had five wheels fall off his car -- in Brooklyn, of course.
