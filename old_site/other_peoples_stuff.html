	<p><h3><strong>Popular Music</strong></h3></p>
	<p>Popular music is awesome. Basically, anything that's been performed or recorded since the early 20th Century is of interest to me -- scratch that, it's an addiction. I spend far too much time surrendering to "Acute LinerNotesomania," and now you can, too.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.the-breaks.com">The Breaks, aka The Sample Faq</a></p>
	<p>Ever wonder who first laid down the funk underneath Ice Cube's <a href="http://www.the-breaks.com/perl/search.pl?term=it+was+a+good+day&type=7">"Today Was a Good Day"</a>? Do you ever doubt that <a href="http://www.the-breaks.com/perl/search.pl?term=james+brown&type=0">James Brown</a> is truly the progenitor of every hip-hop artist out there? Then Blaine's awesome searchable database -- and consistently interesting blog -- is for you. When it's actually up and running properly, it's an astounding wealth of information on jackin' for beats.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.inkblotmagazine.com">Ink Blot Magazine</a></p>
	<p>This site writes about music like few others do: with passion, with knowledge, with wit. One of those sites where you go in to read a single album review, and one hour later, you find out that many consider Marvin Gaye's <a href="http://www.inkblotmagazine.com/rev-archive/Marvin_Gaye_Here_My_Dear.htm">Here, My Dear</a> his best album, with good reason. Seems to specialize in just-below-the-radar rock and hip-hop.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.allmusicguide.com">All Music Guide</a></p>
	<p>Ever since Amazon.com bought out <a href="http://www.cdnow.com">CDNOW</a>, and in the process eliminated all the awesome detail and inter-linking they offered ("Hmm, I wonder what other albums <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDSUB040401182302310805&sql=Bfbdayl6jxpmb">Richard "Groove" Holmes</a> played the B-3 on?"), this has been my source of musical data/trivia. The layout is kind of ugly, I sometimes which team of monkeys they have writing the reviews, and the "Artist Browser" comparison box is entirely useless. But for when you absolutely must know what label the Misfits' <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDSUB040401182302310805&sql=Aox6tk6hxqkr0">"Static Age"</a> EP came out on, it's the best place to start.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.theonionavclub.com">The Onion's AV Club</a></p>
	<p>An arts review site that is about as critical, insightful and well-written as its parent parody-newspaper is funny. They cover the gamut, from <a href="http://www.theonionavclub.com/review.php?review_id=7095">Britney</a> to the <a href="http://www.theonionavclub.com/review.php?review_id=7140">latest Stones' Throw release</a>, and, while not exactly written for those without some knowledge on their subjects, they make a clear argument for or against the album -- something you can't always say about the <em>intelligentsia</em> that ply this trade at mainstream pubs.
