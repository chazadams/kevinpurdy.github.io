	<p>The Roaring Nineties	
	<br>By Joseph E. Stiglitz
	<br>Norton
	<br>256 pages, $25.95</p>

	<P>It's been shown that certain people will pay huge sums for a 
      one-hour lunch with Warren Buffett, where they probably get a few nuggets 
      of wisdom in the investing guru's trademark folksy style.
      <P>So for those looking for the ultimate insider's perspective on the last 
      decade's roller-coaster economy, who wouldn't want to get a book's worth 
      of insights from Joseph E. Stiglitz, winner of the Nobel Prize for 
      Economics, former chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic 
      Advisers and chief economist at the World Bank, and author of the 
      prescient "Globalization and Its Discontents"?
      <P>Unfortunately, anyone looking for an insightful one-on-one with the man 
      who helped shape "The Roaring Nineties" is out of luck. Instead, you're 
      stuck at the longest cocktail party in history, hearing vague and tedious 
      "if only" stories from a man with a serious ax to grind.
      <P>Stiglitz's attempt at "a new history of the world's most prosperous 
      decade" isn't really that at all. Instead, we follow the lauded economist 
      through most every policy issue that came across the Clinton 
      administration's desk, and we learn that even one of the most prestigious 
      and noble jobs in the country has its share of rote and occasional 
      insignificance.
      <P>Here's how it goes in a typical chapter: issues of great import, about, 
      say, accounting regulation or telecom deregulation, come across the 
      Council of Economic Advisers' desk; Stiglitz looks at the recent history 
      of the issue, focusing on the damage done by "the previous 12 years of 
      policy" (aka Ronald Reagan and George Bush); he and the advisers make a 
      sound, forward-looking proposal; the advisers are then ignored.
      <P>Stiglitz does at least attempt an honest retelling of extremely 
      familiar material, faulting Clinton often for giving in to the 
      conservative thinking prevalent at the time and relying on economic 
      welfare to right society's wrongs, while also getting in a flurry of jabs 
      at the Treasury Department, Alan Greenspan, Congress and other tall 
      opponents.
      <P>But we get little or no insight into why or how they specifically 
      brought about the reckless soaring and inevitable crash of the market, 
      other than not listening to that helpful chairman. Sure, Stiglitz offers 
      up alternative courses for everything, especially policies with developing 
      nations, but he doesn't so much punctuate his arguments with opinion as he 
      brackets them with "I doubt," "It's possible," and his personal favorite, 
      "mistakes were made."
      <P>In "Globalization," written immediately after he left the World Bank, 
      Stiglitz showed a reassuring skill for non-partisan critique, followed by 
      a broad but well-defined philosophy for social justice. With "The Roaring 
      Nineties," he offers a view from way on high of who's to blame for the 
      decade's "irrational exuberance," offers lessons in "How to Mismanage the 
      Economy" that make George W. Bush out to be some sort of monetary Dr. 
      Evil, and then offers an annoyingly vague vision "Toward a New Democratic 
      Idealism."
      <P>One can imagine having an actual cocktail with Stiglitz might shake 
      loose a searching, biting tale of the whos, whats and whys of the curious 
      '90s. Instead, it's as if we're hearing it second-hand, from an avid 
      Economist reader who knows Stiglitz well.
