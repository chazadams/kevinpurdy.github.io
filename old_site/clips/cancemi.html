is closing his Pine Avenue furniture store</font></h4>

            <p><a href="http://www.niagara-gazette.com/homepage/local_story_357002703.html">The
Niagara Gazette</a></p>

            <p>Dec. 23, 2006</p>

            <p>By KEVIN PURDY</p>

            <p>Vincent A. &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; Cancemi
started selling
furniture in 1971, hauling around catalogue items in the trunk of his
very compact Dodge.</p>

            <p>More than 35 years later, Cancemi is working a
late night &mdash;
like almost every night &mdash; in his namesake Pine Avenue store. </p>

            <p>He&rsquo;s reminiscing about the spaces
he&rsquo;s occupied
between then and now, and he still can&rsquo;t believe his good
fortune at ending up here. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;When I was growing up, if you made it
onto Pine Avenue,
you&rsquo;d made it,&rdquo; Cancemi said. &ldquo;Everything
was happening there. It&rsquo;s where all my goombahs
were.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>By the end of January, the late nights probably
won&rsquo;t be a
thing of the past. But Cancemi Furniture, the store that occupies a
half-block of Pine Avenue, will be. </p>

            <p>Last month, Cancemi, 64, sold his property to what
he said was
&ldquo;a major corporation.&rdquo; His store will be open extra
hours until its furniture is sold, or before his property&rsquo;s
new tenants decide he has to move out. </p>

            <p>Real estate records show V.J. Cancemi Associates
sold the
14,840-square-foot property on the corner of 26th Street to an
Atlanta-based company named RentProp for $340,000 on Nov. 17. </p>

            <p>Other Pine Avenue merchants said that
Arkansas-based representatives of
a furniture store chain have been in the area recently. Cancemi would
not name the company behind the purchase, but said the property would
likely be sub-divided. </p>

            <p><strong>Staying with a tradition</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Charles O. Marazzo, owner of Latina Importing Co.
on Pine Avenue and a
longtime friend of Cancemi&rsquo;s, said the furniture store is
just the latest in a long line of small businesses driven off the
storied strip. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard for somebody
like Jimmy to do
business nowadays, to compete with the Raymour &amp;
Flanigans,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He did a good job, as a
salesman and at picking the items he liked. Now it doesn&rsquo;t
matter how good you are, you just have to buy 25 couches or something
like that.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>Cancemi said the city&rsquo;s declining
population has also taken a
toll on his business. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;When I started out, there were 23
furniture stores in the
city,&rdquo; Cancemi said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the last guy
here, the last independent one. Now there won&rsquo;t be
any.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>Before the recent offer for his building, Cancemi
had never considered
closing down his store. </p>

            <p>Not when he found out in the mid-1990&rsquo;s
that he owed roughly
$230,000 in back taxes and economic development loans &mdash; a
story Cancemi says he can&rsquo;t talk about, other than to say he
thought an employee had been paying them. </p>

            <p>Not when, soon after the tax discovery, state
environmental inspectors
found low-level petroleum contamination in a city right of way near his
store, scuttling a refinancing effort and forcing Cancemi to turn to
friends for money. </p>

            <p>Even when the city was threatening to foreclose on
him in 1998, Cancemi
said he wouldn&rsquo;t seriously consider closing his shop. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;My pride would never let me,&rdquo;
he said. </p>

            <p><strong>&ldquo;A great loss to our
area&rdquo;</strong> </p>

            <p>With his private and public debts paid off,
Cancemi said he has no
regrets, other than wishing he&rsquo;d had more time to spend with
his sons &mdash; Vincent, now 30, and Anthony, 17. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;It was a hard decision &hellip; but
it&rsquo;s been
a good run,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a lot of
work, but I&rsquo;ve never considered it &lsquo;a
job.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve enjoyed every day of it.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>Marilyn Lojek, a former head of the Pine Avenue
Business Association
who remembers buying from Cancemi during his trunk-sale days, described
the closing of Cancemi&rsquo;s as &ldquo;a great loss to our
area.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fixture on Pine
Avenue, and a fixture in
our city,&rdquo; Lojek said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a wonderful
decorator, he&rsquo;s done so much for the Business Association,
the Boys &amp; Girls Club &hellip; people can&rsquo;t
believe he&rsquo;s closing.&rdquo; </p>

            <p><strong>From trunks to showrooms</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Cancemi was born and raised in Niagara Falls, the
son of Anthony, a
fruit peddler, and Paula. His father died when Cancemi was 7 years old,
and his mother worked at Sears Roebuck and other jobs to make ends
meet. </p>

            <p>While in college he started working for an
interior decorator,
installing draperies and other items. His taste and knack for
decorating led him to start a small business selling furnishings from
his home and his car. </p>

            <p>He grew into a space on Highland Avenue, above the
former Prestolite
building, and then to a space on Sixth Street, before purchasing the
property at 2525 Pine Ave. from Robert L. Andrews in 1989. </p>

            <p>Cancemi expanded the space to make room for
repair, storage and
painting operations, and told the Gazette in 1998 that sales, at their
peak, had reached about $1.2 million per year. </p>

            <p>More than anything, Cancemi enjoys tackling entire
rooms customers are
buying for, especially when he gets to travel to the homes themselves. </p>

            <p>He admits to being somewhat strong-willed, a
quality testified to in a
poem written about him by former Mayor Jacob A. Palillo, tacked to a
wall in his break room: </p>

            <p>&ldquo;You go in to buy your choice / of a
dresser, lamp and bed, /
by the time you leave you end up/ with Jimmy&rsquo;s choice,
instead.&rdquo; </p>

            <p><strong>Saying goodbye</strong> </p>

            <p>Cancemi retired five years ago from working days
as a special education
teacher at Niagara Falls High School. He doesn&rsquo;t have any
plans for after the liquidation sale is finished. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t taken a real
vacation in 35
years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My family says about me,
&lsquo;Jimmy can go anywhere he wants, as long as he&rsquo;s
back in a few hours.&rsquo; &rdquo; </p>

            <p>Shortly before closing Thursday, Dorothy Cancemi
Frost,
Jimmy&rsquo;s sister &mdash; &ldquo;My left hand and my
right hand around here,&rdquo; he says &mdash; was talking with
a couple who were long-time customers., both about their recent couch
purchase and the birth of their three new grandchildren. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been like a family
reunion since we put the
word out,&ldquo; Frost said. &ldquo;They come in, they tell us
what&rsquo;s been going on &hellip; we&rsquo;re going to
miss them.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>Cancemi may agree, but his take on closing after
more than three
decades comes more from experience than sentiment. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m probably going to see
everybody come in, at
least once,&ldquo; he said. &ldquo;Everybody loves a funeral in
Niagara Falls.&rdquo; </p>
