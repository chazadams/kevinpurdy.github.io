      News<BR>John Kessel, president of the glass workers' Buffalo unit, stands 
      near the piles of discarded dishes outside the Bailey Avenue plant. Kessel 
      said the plant's 450 workers can't compete with imports from China or 
      Mexico.<BR>Nancy Jasinski tries to digest the impact of the plant's 
      closing during lunch Thursday. Jasinski, a union steward, said she 
      believes most workers will reject givebacks since 100 employees were laid 
      off in June.

      <P>Community leaders and union officials say they hope to save 
      <EM><B>Buffalo</B></EM> <EM><B>China</B></EM>, but they may have an uphill 
      fight to preserve the 100-year-old company and its 450 jobs.
      <P>Owner Oneida Ltd. announced Wednesday it is considering closing the 
      tableware plant and warehouse on Bailey Avenue, among other cost cutting 
      moves. Production would be farmed out to overseas contractors.

    <TD>Assemblyman Brian M. Higgins, D-Buffalo, said a company official told 
      him that contractors enjoy a cost structure 30-50 percent lower than 
      <EM><B>Buffalo</B></EM> <EM><B>China</B></EM>.
      <P>"If we can minimize the cost differential, perhaps we have a chance 
      here," Higgins said.
      <P>Development officials said they don't know yet what incentives might be 
      available, or whether they can make the plant viable.
      <P><EM><B>Buffalo</B></EM> <EM><B>China</B></EM> already benefits from 
      several public incentives, including a 10-year property tax discount and 
      trade zone status that makes it cheaper to import plates for finishing, 
      said Charles Webb, executive director of the Erie County Industrial 
      Development Agency.
      <P>But other benefits may be available to improve the plant's competitive 
      stance, he said.
      <P>"You treat manufacturers as an endangered species," Webb said. "At the 
      end of another week we should be able to assess if the patient is alive."
      <P><EM><B>Buffalo</B></EM> <EM><B>China</B></EM> never collected a 
      $150,000 grant awarded last year by the Empire State Development Corp., 
      agency spokesman Eric Mangan said, because it fell short of job-creation 
      targets. Similarly, the bulk of $410,000 in training grants awarded at the 
      same time went unspent.
      <P>Union officials are also mulling their response to the company's 
      bombshell. The Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics &amp; Allied Workers 
      International Union will consider whether to offer concessions, 
      communications director Richard Kline said.
      <P>Members of the glass workers' union earn an average $13 an hour at 
      <EM><B>Buffalo</B></EM> <EM><B>China</B></EM> under a contract that 
      expires in July 2005, he said.
      <P>"The company has said it's open to suggestions. . . . We anticipate 
      we'll be in discussions," he said.
      <P>Many <EM><B>Buffalo</B></EM> <EM><B>China</B></EM> workers heard of the 
      potential closing from news reports. John Kessel, president of the glass 
      workers' Buffalo unit, said Oneida representatives told him of the 
      possible closing late Wednesday afternoon, about an hour before the 
      general announcement.
      <P>"We're all devastated -- it's pretty grim in there," he said. "We just 
      celebrated our 100 year anniversary a little while ago."
      <P>Kessel said company executives told him that labor costs are the only 
      expense that could be reduced at <EM><B>Buffalo</B></EM> 
      <EM><B>China's</B></EM> factory and warehouse, and asked union 
      representatives to submit cost savings plans.
      <P>But whether workers will agree to concessions is another question. 
      Union steward Nancy Jasinski said she believes most workers will reject 
      givebacks.
      <P>"Most people are saying 'No, that we've worked too hard to get where we 
      are,' " she said. "We've laid off 100 people already, to take a pay cut as 
      well doesn't make sense." The plant cut its third manufacturing shift in 
      June.
      <P>Oneida officials repeated Thursday that the money-losing company faces 
      drastic measures. The central New York-based company lost $7 million in 
      the first half of its fiscal year, putting it out of compliance with loan 
      agreements.
      <P>"We will take the necessary actions to return our company to 
      profitability, no matter how unpleasant it may be to the individuals and 
      the locations involved," chief executive Peter J. Kallet said during a 
      conference call with company analysts.
      <P>Besides <EM><B>Buffalo</B></EM> <EM><B>China</B></EM>, the company is 
      considering closing four plants abroad that suffer low production volume. 
      Buffalo is one of the company's larger facilities and has significant 
      unused capacity, Kallet said.
      <P>With about 2,000 workers overseas, Oneida is already a major importer 
      of china, silver and glasses, importing about 65 percent of the tableware 
      it sells in the United States, Kallet said.
      <P>Kessel of the glass workers said the union will work with Oneida to 
      keep the Buffalo plant operating, but believes "it will be tough to win."
      <P>"We've never had to compete with other unions or non-union companies, 
      we've always just tried to sell a better product," he said. "Imports are 
      the bottom line of what they told us, and in some ways, we just can't 
      compete with China or Mexico."
      <P>Closing the china plant would also eliminate 85 full- and part-time 
      jobs for people with disabilities at Goodwill Industries in Buffalo, 
      president Florence M. Conti said. Workers at the nonprofit agency assemble 
      racks that hold dishes during the manufacturing process.
