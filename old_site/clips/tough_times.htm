      <P>Matthew Deschamps has worked as a pizza cook in three different Buffalo 
      restaurants, a fair amount of work experience for a 17-year-old.
      <P>That's why it's frustrating for him to have to send out more than 30 
      applications to restaurants, supermarkets and other companies and hear the 
      same response from each: "We'll call you when something opens up."

    <TD>"I think it's a lot harder this summer," said Deschamps, who is 
      entering his senior year at South Park High School. "A lot of kids are 
      staying at the same jobs they had this year. My friends and I are looking 
      at roofing and landscaping-type jobs, something temporary for now."
      <P>Deschamps' situation is typical of many teens this summer in Western 
      New York and across the nation, as they face the worst summer job market 
      in nearly 40 years, according to a study commissioned by the National 
      League of Cities Institute for Youth, Education and Families.
      <P>The study, prepared by the Center for Labor Market Studies at 
      Northeastern University, says 37.3 percent of teens were employed between 
      January and April of this year, an 8 percent decrease from the same period 
      two years ago.
      <P>That weakening teen employment rate, as well as a faltering national 
      economy and cuts to summer job programs, are evidence of the worst market 
      for teenagers in decades.
      <P>As high schools let out for the summer last month, the national 
      unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds rose 0.8 of a percentage point 
      to 19.3 percent, as 611,000 people, many of them teenagers, entered the 
      labor market but were unable to find work, according to the Bureau of 
      Labor Statistics.
      <P>The national teen jobless rate for June -- which, unlike the lower 
      federal figure, includes those who have given up looking for work -- rose 
      to 59.1 percent, the highest June unemployment rate in 55 years and the 
      highest ever for a summer month, according to an analysis of labor 
      statistics by the Children's Defense Fund. Among minorities, teen 
      unemployment was even higher, with 78.3 percent of black and 68.4 percent 
      of Latino teens without work.
      <P>For teens like Kristen Brent, who admits she may have started late in 
      looking for jobs after her junior year at Williamsville East High School, 
      the flooded teen market means giving up on the numerous applications she 
      sent out to stores along Transit Road, and accepting whatever comes up.
      <P>"I'm pretty desperate right now. I'd wash dishes, I'd clean toilets, 
      I'd do anything," Brent said.
      <P>College students are also feeling the effects of the diminished summer 
      job market, said Stephanie Zuckerman-Aviiles, director of career 
      development at Buffalo State College. More students are either sticking 
      with the part-time jobs they kept in high school and throughout last year, 
      or are traveling and studying abroad, Zuckerman-Aviiles said.
      <P>Morgan O'Donnell, 20, of Buffalo, is one of the lucky ones. An 
      advertising major at West Virginia University, she returned this summer to 
      claim her job at Sweet Tooth on Elmwood Avenue.
      <P>O'Donnell, who has been working for Sweet Tooth during Christmas and 
      summer breaks since May 2002, said she's thankful that she didn't have to 
      deal with the stress of a summer job search.
      <P>"I have to work during the summer to pay for my apartment, books and 
      bills," said O'Donnell. "I like to work here. . . . It's fun, I get to 
      meet a lot of different people who come into the shop."
      <P>Anna Hejmanowski, a sophomore education major at D'Youville College, 
      had worked as a gymnastics instructor at the Southtowns YMCA branch for 
      the last six summers, but the construction of a new facility this year 
      left her without a definite job and looking for work. She was one of 
      around 200 applicants to the recently opened Build-A-Bear Workshop, which 
      hired about 30 employees when it opened in May.
      <P>"I wanted to stay with jobs involving children, and I figured 
      Build-A-Bear was the best job out there right now," said Hejmanowski. "I'd 
      have liked to stay at the after-school program, but they couldn't be sure 
      they'd have a job for me."
      <P>Buffalo State's Center for Excellence in Urban and Rural Education 
      normally provides around 100 education students part-time jobs in Buffalo 
      city schools through its Summer in the City program, giving them teaching 
      experience beyond their traditional student teaching internship, said 
      Wynnie Fisher, the program's director.
      <P>This year, however, a political battle between Gov. George E. Pataki 
      and the State Legislature held up $25 million in federal funding for 
      25,000 summer jobs, mainly for underprivileged youth, until late June, and 
      the Summer in the City program didn't receive funding early enough to set 
      up positions for its members, Fisher said.
      <P>"It's really more of a loss for the city. The students get familiarized 
      with an urban setting, and the majority come out loving the city of 
      Buffalo and wanting to teach here," Fisher said.
      <P>Jeff Nixon, director of the city's summer youth employment training 
      program, said nearly 800 children, aged 14 to 17, would have lost 
      on-the-job training opportunities this summer if state funding hadn't come 
      through, but the program "made some optimistic planning ahead" and assumed 
      the funds would come through.
      <P>While the studies and figures may look grim, John Slenker, the State 
      Labor Department's regional economist in Buffalo, believes there are 
      plenty of jobs for teenagers in the area.
      <P>Restaurants, especially those with outdoor patios, parks and retail 
      outlets are where the majority of teen jobs are every summer, and all 
      experience turnover, even in a depressed economy, Slenker said.
      <P>"Teens can still find their niche this summer. It's tighter than it has 
      been, but the jobs are still out there," Slenker said.
      <P>Six Flags Darien Lake hires 2,400 people each summer, 55 to 60 percent 
      of whom are under 21, said Eileen Pozda, director of human resources. 
      While the number of adults and seniors looking to supplement their income 
      or replace depleted retirement savings has increased this year, almost any 
      teenager has a shot at a position, Pozda said.
      <P>"I don't care how old you are, if your application is complete and your 
      dress is a bit nicer than most kids, we'll hire you," said Pozda.
      <P>Deschamps, who filled out more than 10 applications Monday at Walden 
      Galleria, said he is still holding out for a job, but may have to delay 
      plans to purchase a car next year.
      <P>"I'm trying to be hopeful, but it might be too late now," Deschamps 
      said. "Pretty soon, I'm going to have to do anything I can to get some 
      money."
