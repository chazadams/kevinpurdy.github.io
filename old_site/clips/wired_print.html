	<p>Wired - A Romance
	<br>By Gary Wolf
	<br>Random house
	<br>282 pages, $24.95</p>

	<P>To those armchair analysts whose specialty is hindsight (and there 
      are plenty nowadays), the dot-com boom of the last decade resembled 
      nothing so much as a fluke, a sham, a lie perpetuated by millions of 
      random acts of senseless investment.
      <P>But for the true believers (and there were just as many back then), the 
      technologies emerging at the time were so profound they were almost 
      spiritual: daring investors were "angels," arguments over software were 
      "religious disputes," and for the Internet companies giving their product 
      away for free, promises of a future revenue plan caused an almost 
      messianic fervor.
      <P>Enter shaggy visionary Louis Rossetto, his tireless companion Jane 
      Metcalfe, and their magazine Wired, which for a brief period -- 1993 to 
      1997, to be precise -- lead the choir in the song of a Digital Revolution 
      that Rossetto believed was "whipping through our lives like a Bengali 
      typhoon."
      <P>Gary Wolf, a former Wired editor, sets out not to chronicle the 
      now-familiar tale of a technology start-up outgrowing the bounds of 
      reality, but to tell "the story of its story." He succeeds mightily at 
      capturing the college-dorm atmosphere of Wired's San Francisco offices and 
      the characters more colorful than even its groundbreaking pages, but in 
      telling the "romance," he falters with an over-stuffed third act.
      <P>Wolf's hero is of the atypical variety that flourished in the period. A 
      former Libertarian cover-boy and homeless global wanderer, Rossetto 
      believed so fiercely in the power of the revolution that he attempted to 
      sell his half-magazine, half-Internet-catalyst to investors as "a new type 
      of global media company that sells branded content with attitude," in a 
      prospectus with fluorescent ink and a gatefold cover.
      <P>Rossetto and his constantly morphing company attracted the same 
      vanguard they served, the outcast geeks and individualistic executives who 
      regularly ended up on magazine covers. Take Carl Steadman, the 19-year-old 
      programmer for whom the first issue of Wired was akin to a ticket out of 
      irrelevancy:
      <P>"A rural youth of extreme intelligence is almost certain to be unhappy. 
      Among other deprivations there is nobody to talk to. Carl Steadman's 
      rustication was extreme; ditto his misery. If there were 356 residents of 
      Dent, Minnesota, aside from Carl, then to 355 of them, at least, the 
      short, thin, wispy-haired, round-headed teenager inspired either 
      indifference or irritation."
      <P>As Wired grows (mostly on paper) on the backs of such characters, 
      Wolf's prose and pacing are concise and deft. But the manic growth of the 
      Web division HotWired and fallout of a disastrous Initial Public Offering 
      attempt bring in a flood of new investors, back-stabbers and last-minute 
      decisions that would set any manager's head spinning, let alone a 
reader's.
      <P>Wolf's insider perspective gives all the fascinating e-mails, phone 
      calls and mumbled asides one could expect, but the thrill dulls a bit as 
      Wired approaches its IPO, the Royal Ball of the tech boom's Cinderella 
      stories. Michael Lewis' profile of Jim Clark in "The New New Thing" and 
      Michael Wolff's biting "Burn Rate" both provide tighter suspense as mounds 
      of public cash loom.
      <P>Wired wasn't like any of the companies it covered, however, and the 
      story of the libertarian wanderer and his magazine-as-firestarter is a 
      fascinating one. Reading it now, after the dot-com bubble has been 
      thoroughly deflated, is an invigorating exercise in alternative recent 
      history.
