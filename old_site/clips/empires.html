	<p>Empires of Light
	<br>By Jill Jonnes
	<br>Random House
	<br>415 pages, $27.95</p>

	<P>Given only the basic high school history of electricity -- a noble line 
      drawn from Benjamin Franklin's kite and key to Thomas Edison's 
      incandescent bulb -- a good number of us may be startled to learn some of 
      its lesser-known characters: a Buffalo axe murderer, a Serbian genius 
      deathly afraid of pearls on women, and a score of dogs, ranging from cute 
      puppies to mangy mongrels, that came to a sizzling end in Edison's 
      laboratories.
      <P>All this and much, much more is packed into Jill Jonnes' "Empires of 
      Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World," 
      an exhaustive look at one of the Gilded Age's fiercest contests, the "War 
      of the Electric Currents." Jonnes' tale occasionally ventures into college 
      lecture territory when searching too far afield for context or 
      overemphasizing key points, but it's a fascinating introduction for 
      neophytes, and of particular interest to those in Buffalo, the aptly 
      self-named City of Light.
      <P>"Empires" rises and falls on its central conceit, that the world's 
      electrical prospects were shaped by three fascinating characters. There's 
      Edison, the famous folksy inventor who saw incandescent lighting as his 
      entry to industrial fortunes; George Westinghouse, the charming 
      entrepreneur who played only to win; and Nikola Tesla, the inventor who 
      helped define "eccentric" and possessed an almost wizardly understanding 
      of the earth's unseen forces.
      <P>After a mildly interesting introduction and overly extensive history of 
      electrical discoveries, we're introduced to Edison at about page 50. You 
      can almost hear the hum of microfilm projectors as Jonnes delves deep into 
      the ramshackle labs of industrial towns, the manure-lined streets of late 
      19th-century New York, and rather obsessive accounts of nearly every 
      person's facial hair arrangements along the way. Her thumbnail of Edison 
      is actually one of the lesser feats of archival wizardry in the book:
      <P>"In an age of great formality, when gentlemen wore fine Prince Albert 
      suits, a proper stiff collar and cravat, and a shiny silk top hat when 
      venturing forth in public, Edison preferred to play the unschooled hick at 
      Menlo Park, affecting rumpled blue flannel workman's suits, silk 
      neckerchiefs, a simple cloth skullcap, and solid boots. In truth, Edison 
      was a voracious and penetrating reader, hungry for knowledge and 
      possessing an amazing memory. His early deafness only made him more likely 
      to lose himself in a book."
      <P>So fierce was the competition between Edison's direct current and 
      Westinghouse's alternating current that, at around page 150, one can't 
      help but hold contempt for Edison, the archetypal hero of down-home 
      inventors, as he forgoes personal ethics to push New York state toward 
      adopting electrocution -- using Westinghouse generators, of course -- and 
      has his lackeys pay children a quarter for every dog they bring to his 
      labs for "testing."
      <P>Once you warm to the irresistible charms of Tesla, and follow South 
      Division Street resident William Kemmler from drunken murder to horrific 
      electrocution, you're hooked. Jonnes -- who did extensive local research 
      with the Niagara Falls Public Library, Buffalo &amp; Erie County 
      Historical Society, Niagara Power and Niagara Mohawk -- also paints a 
      vivid picture of the triumphant moment when the Falls first lit up the 
      Queen City (and is blurbed on the book's jacket by "City of Light" author 
      Lauren Belfer).
      <P>Tesla, at that time, addressed a high-spirited crowd in Buffalo's 
      Ellicott Club with his perfect, heavily accented English: "Let me wish 
      that in no time distant your city will be a worthy neighbor of the great 
      cataract which is one of the great wonders in nature."
      <P>Jonnes takes a long time making her way through that period, when the 
      air was literally sparking with promise, but it's ultimately worth the 
      investment in "Empire."
