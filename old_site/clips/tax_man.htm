      <EM><B>Hewitt's</B></EM> Liberty Tax Service has been ranked 106 by Inc. 
      magazine on their 2003 list of the 500 fastest-growing private companies. 
      It has 919 franchise operations in the United States and Canada since 
      starting in 1997.
      <P><BR>
      <P>John <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> makes no bones about it: He likes talking 
      about himself and his company, Liberty Tax, more than anything.
      <P>"I'm a shameless self-promoter. Probably one of the biggest you'll ever 
      see," said <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM>, taking a break from an order of Duff's 
      chicken wings, ordered hot, and from explaining his firm's success.

    <TD>"Sometimes I go a little too far, but if you're not out there pushing 
      yourself, pushing your company, you shouldn't even be in this business," 
      said <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM>.
      <P>Since graduating from Hamburg High School in 1967, 
      <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM>, 54, has thrown himself at the tax service business 
      three times, been bruised twice, and come back each time with a simple, 
      ambitious plan: to be the No. 1 tax service franchise in the world.
      <P><EM><B>Hewitt's</B></EM> Liberty Tax Service, which Inc. magazine 
      ranked 106 on their 2003 list of the 500 fastest-growing private U.S. 
      companies, has grown to 919 franchise operations in the United States and 
      Canada since starting in 1997, with roughly 300 of those added in the last 
      year.
      <P>He aims to double his company's size to 1,800 in about two years, then 
      do it again by around 2008 with 3,600 operations. His return to Western 
      New York last weekend was all about building franchises: holding a job 
      fair to recruit new ones, and attending a training session in Niagara 
      Falls, Ont., to meet 12 new ones from Canada.
      <P>"The most important asset we have is our franchises. I meet every one 
      of the owners. I go to the training sessions to offer advice, and they can 
      never say they didn't get any questions answered. I'll answer anything," 
      said <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM>.
      <P>Even if Liberty Tax grows to the sizes he envisions, 
      <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> said he doesn't fear losing touch with franchises, 
      or growing too large too quickly.
      <P>"The biggest thing I fear is that I won't be No. 1," said 
      <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM>. "Do I really want a gravestone that says, 'No. 2 
      in the tax business?' "
      <P><EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> knows his competition well. In his second year 
      at the University at Buffalo, he took a tax course offered by H&amp;R 
      Block, and eventually left school to take a position in a local office. 
      After 12 years at the firm, he was promoted to regional director, the 
      youngest the firm has had.
      <P><EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> saw promise in the early-model Apple personal 
      computer his father purchased, and with him developed one of the first tax 
      software programs for PCs, "Hewtax." He pitched it to H&amp;R Block, they 
      turned him down, and <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> left to build the small 
      accounting firm that would become Jackson <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> Tax 
      Service.
      <P>In 1996, after 14 years at Jackson <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM>, stockholders 
      began looking to sell the company, while <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> wanted to 
      continue building. He was forced out of his CEO position that year, and 
      after receiving 5 percent of the firm's $483 million sale to Parsippany, 
      N.J.-based Cendant Corp., left to start his own firm.
      <P>A non-compete agreement kept him from opening any tax firms in the 
      United States., so <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> started Liberty Tax in nearby 
      Canada. After his agreement expired in 1999, he began operations in the 
      states, with Buffalo serving as one of the first focus areas for his 
      business.
      <P>Dannalee Saunders was one of the first to open a U.S. Liberty Tax 
      office in 2000, and now operates two locally. Although her "trial period" 
      during the first tax season was trying, she said, the close communication 
      between Liberty's management and its franchises is its strongest marketing 
      tool.
      <P>"Once a week, all the franchisees can join in on a conference call with 
      John and others. He takes a ton of questions from people all over," said 
      Saunders. "Everybody buys into Liberty because of John. Otherwise, we'd go 
      with another firm, or a mom-and-pop tax office."
      <P>Liberty Tax, headquartered in Virginia, is still relatively small 
      compared with its competitors: H&amp;R Block has more than 8,000 U.S. 
      offices, and Jackson <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> around 2,700. But 
      <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> points out that Liberty has grown many times faster 
      than H&amp;R, Jackson and others did in their first six years.
      <P>Linda McDougall, vice president of communications at H&amp;R Block, 
      said in a written statement that smaller firms like Liberty are not 
      factored into the company's marketing efforts.
      <P>"Our marketing is not aimed at smaller competitors, but rather at 
      demonstrating how H&amp;R Block, as the country's largest tax preparation 
      firm, can help Americans not only with all of their tax needs, but also 
      with their longer-term financial goals," said McDougall.
      <P><EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> believes he has in fact gained the tax giant's 
      notice, evidenced by a 2000 lawsuit he won in Virginia against H&amp;R 
      Block for false advertising, targeted at Liberty's focus market, for 
      $800,000.
      <P><EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM> said he's being courted by investment firms to 
      take Liberty Tax public -- something he'll consider when the economy 
      improves a bit more -- but he holds enough stock in Liberty that he can't 
      be bought out again. He also said he plans to keep listening to young 
      franchisers, who might see things the higher-ups can't.
      <P>"It's a simple motto I work by: If it ain't broke, break it," said 
      <EM><B>Hewitt</B></EM>.
