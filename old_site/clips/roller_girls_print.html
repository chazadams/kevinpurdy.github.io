<p>To those who have never seen it, roller derby can look like
hockey, just without a puck, goalies or nets.</p>

<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s more like football without the ball,
and the defensive line is on wheels.</p>

<p>No, the best way to describe it is a roller skating party that
turns suddenly violent for two minutes at a time.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what sport you compare it
to. Most of the roughly 40 Queen City Roller Girls who show up at North
Tonawanda&rsquo;s Rainbow Roller Rink two times a week are looking
for something you can&rsquo;t get in the world of mainstream
women&rsquo;s sports.</p>

<p>Like, for instance, the chance to knock a jammer off their
skates and hear your team mates scream, &ldquo;Yeah,
Tara!&rdquo; &mdash; as in Sheer Tara, #138.</p>

<p>When she&rsquo;s without wheels, Tara is Shannon Smith, a
North Tonawanda resident, worker at the University at
Buffalo&rsquo;s Research Foundation and a library science student.</p>

<p>She heard about the Queen City Roller Girls through
&ldquo;a friend of a friend at a party,&rdquo; but once she
learned the details of what roller derby was, she wanted in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never played a sport before, but from
going to punk shows, I was used to getting knocked around,&rdquo;
Smith said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exercise, it&rsquo;s really
fun and it&rsquo;s something besides computers all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smith, like almost all of the women across the country taking
part in roller derby&rsquo;s grassroots revival, is too young to
remember the International Roller Skating League&rsquo;s televised
matches of the 1970s, let alone the &rsquo;50s and late
&rsquo;60s heyday of the Seltzer family&rsquo;s actual Roller
Derby enterprise.</p>

<p>Until last year, in fact, the only appearances roller derby
made in popular culture were re-runs of IRSL matches on
ESPN&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cheap Seats&rdquo; parody show, or the
little-noticed 2002 remake of the roller derby/science fiction flick
&ldquo;Rollerball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What really got women like Debra Hughes and Ilsa Magnussen
&mdash; a.k.a. Sissy Fit and Flo Torious &mdash; interested in
starting their own league was the A&amp;E reality show
&ldquo;Rollergirls,&rdquo; centering on an Austin-based
all-female league. Through a big of Web searching, they found Roberta
Schwartz, or Sweet Pea, who had experience in a Madison, Wisc.-based
league.</p>

<p>The Queen City team started out as the three founders
attending open skates, passing out fliers and leaving MySpace notes to
gauge interest in April. By August, Hughes said, membership was up to
30 women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think female sports is kind of underrepresented
here,&rdquo; Hughes said. &ldquo;We thought this would be a fun
way to get girls together who weren&rsquo;t necessarily athletic,
who want to join a community of women and exercise at the same
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since launching in mid-2004, the Women&rsquo;s Flat Track
Derby Association now consists of 30 leagues in cities around the
country, with the Queen City league hoping to join soon. The online
user-edited encyclopedia Wikipedia lists more than 130 leagues in the
U.S.</p>

<p>Buffalo&rsquo;s own league hopes to start actual matches
amongst its three teams &mdash; the Devil Dollies, Suicidal Saucies
and Nickel City Knockouts &mdash; in February. They&rsquo;re
still casually recruiting for new members, and a successful season
could lead to a competitive traveling team.</p>

<p>Stacy Ryan, known as Sissy Sparkles to her teammates, was on
the sidelines during a recent practice night at the Rainbow Roller Rink
with a braced knee, the result of a bad fall.</p>

<p>None of the women have been seriously injured, but Ryan and
others at practice said tender ankles and bruises were just a minor
price to pay for the chance to put on pads, inhabit a different name
and feel the force of momentum in a more personal way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d come to work early on with a bruise
or something, and people would say, jokingly, &lsquo;Trouble at
home?&rsquo; &rdquo; Ryan said. &ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s
just, &lsquo;Oh, right, roller derby&rsquo; ... It&rsquo;s
fun to hear that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Rules</strong></p>

Taken from the Women&rsquo;s Flat Track Derby
Association&rsquo;s standardized rules
<ul>

  <li><strong>The Track:</strong> An oval-shaped
track marked off on a flat surface, about 88 feet long, 53 feet wide
and a skating lane about 14 feet wide.</li>

  <li><strong>The Teams:</strong> No more than 14
women that have demonstrated basic skating skills, with five women from
each time in the rink at any time.</li>

  <li><strong>The Bouts:</strong> One match consists
of three 20-minute periods. with a number of 2-minute
&ldquo;jams&rdquo; within them.</li>

  <li><strong>What&rsquo;s happening:</strong>
Three of the women from each team form up in inverted triangles as
&ldquo;blockers.&rdquo; One &ldquo;pivot&rdquo; from
each team skates just in front of their blockers, serving as a last
line of defense. All together, the six blockers and two pivots form
&ldquo;the pack.&rdquo;
One skater from each team serves as a &ldquo;jammer,&rdquo;
whose goal is to pass through or around the pack as many times as
possible within the two-minute jam.</li>

  <li><strong>Blocking and scoring:</strong> Blockers
and pivots can use their hips, shoulders and torso to impede a jammer
or other blockers, but not their elbows. Jammers earn points by passing
blockers and pivots without going out of bounds or committing penalties.</li>

</ul>
