      firearms.<BR>LISTED- So you want to work at <EM><B>Gander</B></EM> 
      Mountain? questions from the product knowledge survey given to job 
      applicants: <BR>
      <P>When <EM><B>Gander</B></EM> Mountain opens its new outdoor sports 
      superstore in the City of Tonawanda on Friday, Bob Keicher will be there.
      <P>The Cheektowaga resident and head of New York's Safari Club 
      International delegation will not only have found a store that caters 
      specifically to him and the SCI's 3,000 or so regional members, he finally 
      will have found the nesting place of that rarest of species: extra-long 
      camouflage hunting pants for women.

    <TD>"Nobody carries a decent supply of ladies' hunting clothes around 
      here," he said. "It's like they're second-class citizens, or hunters 
      rather."
      <P>Along with a location in Henrietta, which opened June 13, 
      <EM><B>Gander</B></EM> Mountain is hoping to capture the attention of 
      fishers, hunters, ATV riders and other outdoor enthusiasts in Western New 
      York, giving them an alternative to catalogs and athletic superstores.
      <P>"We don't get into the stick and ball, or white sneaker market," said 
      Jeff Bergman, vice president of marketing for <EM><B>Gander</B></EM> 
      Mountain. "There's a high degree of outdoor enthusiasts in the Buffalo and 
      Rochester-area markets. We saw a need we thought we could fill, and we're 
      going to do so."
      <P>The Tonawanda store, which fills the former Ames Department store 
      location at 880 Young Street, is one of three new larger-sized 
      "superstores" that <EM><B>Gander</B></EM> has built recently, totaling 
      77,000 square feet compared to the chain's usual 30,000-square-foot 
stores.
      <P>The Tonawanda store will house a larger inventory and some newer 
      features, including an ATV service station, a gunsmith shop that buys, 
      refurbishes and resells firearms, an eight-lane archery range, and a 
      fully-stocked bait station that will open at 5 a.m. to lure in 
      early-morning casters. The larger size also means approximately 200 deer 
      heads and other taxidermy will find space along the store's walls.
      <P>Just as important as capturing business from hunters is providing the 
      hard-to-find gear for their wives and children, said Tim Stafford, the 
      store's general manager. The store will offer hunting and fishing clothes 
      specially made for women and children.
      <P>"We're seeing more families, down to even toddlers, going hunting as a 
      family activity," said Stafford. "It's a growing market."
      <P>Mark McGranahan, who runs Sparky's Charters, said the store's 
      region-specific bait shop will help casual fishers, who make up about 60 
      percent of his business, avoid the common mistakes of neophytes, like 
      buying bait and lures for large mouth bass rather than Lake Erie's large 
      population of the small mouth variety.
      <P>Like Dick's Sporting Goods and Galyan's Trading Company, which<BR>have 
      sporting goods stores in the area, customers can obtain hunting and 
      fishing licenses at <EM><B>Gander</B></EM> Mountain through the state 
      Department of Environmental Conservation's computerized system.
      <P>Stafford believes the training level among his staff is what sets the 
      store apart from Dick's, Galyan's and other stores that offer outdoor 
      sports gear.
      <P>"These guys can tell you where to go, what to use, what's biting, what 
      they're biting on," Stafford said. "They're all fishermen or hunters 
      themselves. Nobody is going to tell you they don't know what you should 
      buy."
      <P>The 120 to 130 employees at <EM><B>Gander</B></EM> Mountain have to 
      know their stuff. When they applied for their jobs, they had to fill out 
      an intensive survey of their knowledge of wilderness products, with 
      questions like:
      <P>Name the six standard shotgun gauges from smallest to largest.
      <P>In fly line selection, what does DT-5-F stand for?
      <P>Name one advantage and one disadvantage to both carbon arrows and 
      aluminum arrows.
      <P>Along with meeting the needs of veteran of outdoor enthusiasts, the 
      store attempts to make close ties between itself and local hunting and 
      fishing clubs. Besides offering an open meeting "lodge," staff 
      presentations to groups and sponsoring tournaments, the store is opening 
      Thursday night to local clubs only, offering a 10 percent discount and 
      turning another 10 percent of a club's purchases back to the group's fund 
      balance.
      <P>Tom Marks, president of the Southtowns Walleye Association, said his 
      group was eager to have an early bait shop and greater selection of goods 
      available locally, rather than having to shop from a catalog or 
      wholesaler. But, he said, he will still shop at Galyan's and Dick's to 
      find deals.
      <P>Joan Hurley, senior vice president of communications for Galyan's 
      Trading Company, said the wilderness sections of the Galyan's stores in 
      Cheektowaga and Rochester could actually benefit from 
      <EM><B>Gander</B></EM> Mountain's presence.
      <P>"When somebody else comes into the market like this, the expansion just 
      creates awareness of the market and the products available, and ultimately 
      benefits us," said Hurley. Galyan's thoroughly researches each market 
      before opening a store, she said, and has focused its Galleria Mall store 
      to serve Western New York's outdoors needs.
      <P>Representatives from Dick's Sporting Goods could not be reached for 
      comment.
      <P>Stafford said the "flood of applications" was a good indicator of the 
      general public's desire to see an outdoor sports store of 
      <EM><B>Gander</B></EM> Mountain's kind in Western New York.
      <P>"People here can pick up a rifle, see how it feels, and then find out 
      what kind of shot to use. You can't get that from a catalog," he said.
