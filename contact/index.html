<p><strong>The best way to reach me is email.</strong></p>
<p>That address is <strong>ks{last name} {at} {gmail.com}</strong></p>
<p>Otherwise, you might try me <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinpurdy">on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Sending me a Facebook message is the most certain way to make sure your message is unseen, or stacked next to an invitation to "Tony's Completely Crazy 32nd Birthday Bar Crawl" (which I probably will not be attending, because Tony is a guy I only somewhat know from high school) (Sorry, Tony).</p>
<p>I have a PGP key pair for discussing sensitive or confidential matters. <a href="Kevin_Purdy_public_key.asc">This is my public key</a>.</p>
<p>See something not quite right with this site? <a href="https://github.com/kevinpurdy/kevinpurdy.github.io/issues">Create or solve an issue on the open-source code</a>, or jump right in and <a href="https://github.com/kevinpurdy/kevinpurdy.github.io/pulls">make a branch</a>. I'm always learning.</p>
