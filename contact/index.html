<p><strong>The best way to reach me is email.</strong></p>
<p>That address is <strong>ks{last name} {at} {gmail.com}</strong></p>
<p>Otherwise, you might try me <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinpurdy">on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Sending me a Facebook message is the most certain way to make sure your message is unseen, or stacked next to an invitation to "Tony's Completely Crazy 32nd Birthday Bar Crawl" (which I probably will not be attending, because Tony is a guy I only somewhat know from high school) (Sorry, Tony).</p>
