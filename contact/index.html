<p class="drop-cap">The best way to reach me is email.</p>
<p>That address is <strong>ks{last name} {at} {gmail.com}</strong></p>
<p>Otherwise, you might try me <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinpurdy">on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Sending me a Facebook message is the most assured way to make sure your message isn't seen for a few days, and is stacked next to an invitation to "Tony's Completely Crazy 40th Birthday Bar Crawl" (which I probably will not be attending, because Steve is a guy I only somewhat know from high school) (Sorry, Tony).</p>
