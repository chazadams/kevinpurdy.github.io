The best way to reach me is email.

That address is **ks{last name} {at} {gmail.com}**

Otherwise, you might try me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kevinpurdy).

Sending me a Facebook message is the most assured way to make sure your message isn't seen for a few days, and is stacked next to an invitation to "Tony's Completely Crazy 40th Birthday Bar Crawl" (which I probably will not be attending, because Tony is a guy I only somewhat know from high school) (Sorry, Tony).
