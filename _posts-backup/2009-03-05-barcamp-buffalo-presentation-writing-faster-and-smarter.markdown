Thanks to [Kevin Lim for shooting and posting](http://theory.isthereason.com/?p=2578), and to [BarCamp Buffalo](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBuffalo) for letting me try out an alpha-level presentation on the late-night crowd.

I'd intended to run through three areas early-morning bloggers can use to sprint through material and write faster, but ended up focusing on one app I could easily keep in the 10-minute time frame. Intrigued? Check out the [full list of tools and tricks](http://thepurdman.com/barcamp-buffalo) referenced at the end of the vid.
