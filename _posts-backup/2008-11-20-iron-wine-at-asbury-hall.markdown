[Iron & Wine](http://www.ironandwine.com/) is one of the very few music acts the wife and I have Absolute Agreement on, so we snapped up tickets to their Nov. 12 gig at Ani DiFranco's [Babeville](http://www.babevillebuffalo.com/), a.k.a. Asbury Hall, as soon as we knew about the gig.

Samuel Beam walked onto the stage of the renovated church hall, looked out from heavy eyes and said, "Wow. I didn't know there were this many people in Buffalo." At that moment, it seemed a bit like ... everything anyone's ever said about Buffalo after spending some real time here (or so I tell myself). Listening to it now, though, it seems more in line with his general shyness and modesty, to see that many people lining the halls of the arching space.

I [teased PlayedLastNight.com a bit](http://twitter.com/kevinpurdy/status/1007261204) about the literalness of their releases, but, one week later, you can [preview, buy and download the whole 18-song, 1-hour-35-minute Iron & Wine set](http://playedlastnight.com/artists/show/163/Iron_Wine_Buffalo_NY_Asbury_Hall) from that show. The basic $9.95 package gets you MP3 files with a 160 kb/s bitrate--decent enough for headphones and non-audiophile enjoyment. $3 more gets you (via email, two days later) FLAC files that haven't lost any audio quality in compression.

Quick tip on the sly: One YouTube user has posted [three full song videos](http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=kristiebenedict&view=videos) from the Asbury Hall gig. Consumer-cam quality, but pretty neat angle.
