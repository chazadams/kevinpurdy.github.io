![Taste of Buffalo 2008](http://thepurdman.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/3_taste_treats1.jpg)

One man, alone (actually, accompanied by a patient wife and/or a friend or two) and unarmed (except with a camera, wallet, iPod touch, keys, a water bottle, pre-applied sunscreen and sunglasses) against a horde (nearly 60, actually) of Buffalo's restaurants, all lined up on one avenue, for two days.

This epic tale can be found over at [Buffalo Buffet](http://buffalobuffet.wordpress.com), where I [described my adventures at Taste of Buffalo 2008](http://buffalobuffet.wordpress.com/2008/07/13/finger-food-fiesta-taste-of-buffalo-2008/). The festival is one of many reasons that a city known for its shovel-thumping winters is a secret treasure in the summer.
