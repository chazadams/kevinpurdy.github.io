_"I don't believe in this Oscar bullshit, but it is the best movie of the year"_

Our local ABC affiliate [WKBW](http://www.wkbw.com), suffering for years under serious cutbacks, accidentally turned the studio microphones on during the big finale of this year's Oscars (post-spoiler: "No Country for Old Men" won). Rather than embarass their last-in-the-market station, however, the staff provide some astute inadvertent commentary. I question whether an [apology](http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:iJWfLBd3siAJ:www.wkbw.com/news/local/15940462.html+wkbw&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us&client=firefox-a) was truly necessary.

My favorite line (in response to co-anchor [Joanna Pasceri](http://www.wkbw.com/about/personalities/newsbios/7275946.html) asking "What's it about?") is from [Keith Radford](http://www.wkbw.com/about/personalities/newsbios/7225086.html): **"Guy with no expression, keeps blowing up everything?"**

I agree with [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/02/buffalos_abc_affiliate_makes_oscars.html) on this one: Give this guy his own live-blog during next year's telecast. (via [Buffalo Pundit](http://buffalopundit.wnymedia.net/blogs/archives/6278), though his link is to the non-embeddable version with better sound).
