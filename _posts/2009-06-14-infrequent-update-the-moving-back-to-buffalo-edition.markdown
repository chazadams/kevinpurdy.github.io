_Maybe the vegetarian meal on Ajira Airlways is some kind of curry dish? That'd be sweet._

Personal blogging is hard when you're updating another blog at least five times per day, and often more. As I put it to my editor recently, it feels like my Who Cares Filter is completely closed up by the time I find myself with time to write in this space. I don't have to write about software, productivity, gadgets, or time management here, of course; it's just a vague feeling that I've linked and updated everything I need to on the net each day.

But! Now it's way too early on a Sunday, and I've got a few things that need sharin'.



  * **The headline:** Yep. Less than six months after moving to Rochester, the wife and I are moving back to our home of more nine years. I defer my feelings on this to an upcoming Roc/Buff open comparison chart I'll be posting (seriously) later this month.


  * **[Food Week at Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/tag/food-week/):** That was seriously fun. I earned some experience doing solo video shoots, interviewing Art Rogers of [Lento](http://lentorestaurant.com) restaurant about [slicing and dicing onions](http://lifehacker.com/5284827/how-to-slice-and-dice-an-onion-like-a-pro) and [fileting a fish](http://lifehacker.com/5287266/how-to-filet-a-fish-like-a-pro).  
  
What did I learn? Per @[jordanconway](http://twitter.com/jordanconway), I might find a bolt that fits in the tripod mount of my [Zi6](http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=13063) and attach it to a lanyard for steadier shots. When shots go wrong ("Macro Mode" my butt), I'll politely ask my subject to back up and re-explain, and I'll keep the camera on the subject (food!) more often.


  * **Rockin' the G1:** Finally joined the realm of folks who can complain about two different kinds of cellular reception. I dig the open nature, the browser is pretty snappy when the bandwidth's there, and certain apps are total killers ([Locale](http://www.twofortyfouram.com/), for one). Many reviewers and iPhone purists have knocked on the hardware, but I see a clear trade-off for the "bulk" and "design choices." Namely, having 3.2 megapixels in your pocket at all times, to shoot ridiculously clear photos and video:

  * **Firefox add-ons for journalists:** Titled [Journalist Picks](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collection/journalist) for now, and it's a work in progress. Got an extension that would help with research, note-taking, or tracking beat subjects online? Drop them in the comments or hit me up on email.
