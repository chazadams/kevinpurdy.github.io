I've got a piece in [this month's insert](http://ny.therealdeal.com/articles/a-look-at-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-housing-markets) to [The Real Deal](http://ny.therealdeal.com/), a New York City-based magazine that covers real estate news, about how Buffalo managed to escape the recent credit and housing downturns. Titled [**Buffalo stays cold â€” and calm**](http://ny.therealdeal.com/articles/buffalo-stays-cold-and-calm), it details how the conditions in Western New York's economy and the character of the city itself have kept over-eager flippers, predatory lenders, and other market-crashers (mostly) at bay.

It's kind of a big deal for me, being my first print published outside the Buffalo-area market (and not on my main squeeze, [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com)). It also generated a bit of discussion [over at Buffalo Rising](http://www.buffalorising.com/story/brrrr_jack_frost_steadies_buff). Here's a standard writerly caveat for you: The story goes much farther than the headline suggests.
