_Of course, this serious-looking piece of hardware is made in Germany._

I've been on two different [WNYC](http://wnyc.org) morning radio shows in the last month or so, talking up Lifehacker-type topics and describing how I watch TV (without cable) and get things done (when I can).

First up, an [appearance on The Takeaway](http://www.thetakeaway.org/stories/2009/jul/09/life-after-television/) with John Hockenberry to talk about living "Life After Television," i.e. switching away from cable to streaming net content (and over-the-air DTV). Click the play icon below to listen:

Next up, I was asked to take part in a month-long series of segments dealing with productivity on [The Brian Lehrer Show](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/episodes/2009/08/06/segments/138135). The first segment was this morning, and I should be on again every Thursday in August, around 10:40 a.m. Here's the embedded clip--hit "More" in the upper-right corner for a download link, if needed:



I'm glad I was able to score another invite with my elite plugging skills near the end. But, seriously, I do listen to [On The Media](http://www.onthemedia.org/) nearly every week. Because I was popular in high school.
