I was a contributor at [Buffalo Buffet](http://buffalobuffet.com), the Western-New-York-centric food blog run by my good friend Andrew Galarneau, from its earliest inception.

Buffalo Buffet, however, is no more. Now the focus is wider, the posts meatier, and the site a bit more agile and active. I'm helping him launch [One Big Kitchen](http://onebigkitchen.com), and so far, it's been a great learning experience, and a good deal of fun.

Right now, I'm managing the "News Bites"--little links and tips, updated nearly-daily, in the left-hand sidebar--and helping out with a lot of the back-end design and WordPress tweaking. In the not-too-distant future, I'm hoping to get some seriously juicy posts up over there, and inviting anyone with similar passions to do the same.

Got a tip, an awesome food link, or an inkling to write your own gastro-post? Email me at **kevin [at] onebigkitchen.com**.
