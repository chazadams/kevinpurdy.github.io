I wrote a post about _[Don't Starve](http://dontstarvegame.com)_ for Games On Delay, the game blog for "Filty Casuals." That means people like me who buy games long after they're new and hot, with lower system requirements.

["Dying as a Feature: Don't Starve and Impermanence (and Beefalo)"](http://gamesondelay.kinja.com/dying-as-a-feature-dont-starve-and-impermanence-and-b-1625190832) was fun to write, and outside my usual milieu.

Games, particularly indie games, are having quite the effect on me in my mid-30's. They seem to be capturing something that I'm not seeing in too many other places.

More to come, perhaps.
