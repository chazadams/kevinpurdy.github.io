![Oh, the (easy) irony.](/assets/uploads/2008/05/blogging_splash1.jpg)

I wrote up today's Top 10 feature on Lifehacker, [Top 10 Tools to Get Blogging Done](http://lifehacker.com/387619/top-10-tools-to-get-blogging-done). I wrote about how tools like Tumblr, Foxmarks, and others can make getting your ideas written and posted much easier.

And, yeah, I haven't posted anything of substance here in a long time. I have no less than five half-thought-out, one-third-written, not-quite-ready posts in draft form. Even when same-day inspiration strikes (New restaurant! New writing clip! Funny thing I found!), it always seems to dissolve when I hit the admin page on this thing, like lime juice into water (I'm really thirsty at the moment).

The biggest reason—blogging for Lifehacker makes up the bulk of my work-work these days. I'm still digging how fun it is to write on-the-fly about technology, but sitting down to write a blog during the off hours feels kind of like, I dunno, returning home from a real estate office and planning how to sell your own home. I've also come to realize the value of away-from-the-screen time, both for getting things done on the home front and for my eyes/mind/hands.

I've toyed with the idea of giving myself a topic, and a regular schedule, to write about here: Buffalo, food, maybe even blogging itself. I'll get around to making a decision sooner than later—assuming blogging doesn't [kill me first](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/technology/06sweat.html).
