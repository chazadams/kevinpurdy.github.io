_Only Thom Yorke can properly express the disillusionment
generated by his recent headlines._

I didn't really notice that I had an AM station on my car radio while I was driving home tonight ... until I heard a CBS News announcer say this:

_Well, those looking to escape the "Karma Police" have their chance ... the band Radiohead is asking fans to ..._

And you probably know the [rest](http://idolator.com/tunes/oct%27-10-is-only-nine-days-away/radioheads-pay+what+you+wish-download-how-much-gold-will-you-throw-at-in-rainbows-305486.php) [of](http://www.stereogum.com/archives/new-radiohead-album-in-rainbows-out-october-10th.html?utm_source=bb&utm_medium=mc) [the](http://www.nme.com/news/radiohead/31506) [story](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/arts/music/02radi.html), despite head-scratching lines like that. It's cheesy and kind of sad, yet somehow not the worst one out there! <strike>Inspired</strike> Sickly fascinated, I ventured into the relevance-clutching music journalism (and blogging!)  to see if there was anything even <strike>better</strike> worse. Here's the bounty:



	
  * [OK, Now What, Mr. Computer?](http://www.cinemablend.com/music/Ok-Now-What-Mr-Computer-6632.html)**: **Cinema Blend reaches just beyond the lengths of anything relevant to the story to pull out this gem. Saved only by the fact that it is, after all, a pretty ridiculously great album.

	
  * [What's at the end of Radiohead's Rainbows?](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/10/03/bmcolumn103.xml): Points for actually mentioning the underlying news that the world's most critically-acclaimed band is releasing a new disc. Demerits for making the boys from Oxfordshire into leprechauns.

	
  * [RADIOHEADING IN A NEW DIRECTION:](http://www.nypost.com/seven/10022007/entertainment/music/radioheading_in_a_new_directio.htm) NY Post headlines are like fresh guacamole -- you always forget how good they are until the next time you sample one.

	
  * [Radiohead's digital album: Priceless](http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=626585&category=ARTS&newsdate=10/2/2007): [What a clever, funny headline](http://thetravisty.com/Family_Guy/wmv/You_Are_The_Weakest_Link.htm).

	
  * [Radiohead's Rainbows Ready to Shine](http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=1c844068-b6b5-4db6-8dcc-65ba18916ed7&sid=fd-news): Much like E! itself, it's kind of phoned-in and doesn't really tell you anything you didn't know. So, in a way, kind of perfect.
