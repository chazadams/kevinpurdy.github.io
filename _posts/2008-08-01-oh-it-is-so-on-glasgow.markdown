Before heading out on a week's vacation, I had to point out the awesomeness of "The Munchie Box," picked up by my friend Andrew at [Buffalo Buffet](http://buffalobuffet.wordpress.com/2008/07/31/a-wee-bite-after-lagers-munchie-box-glasgow-scotland/). The "standard" size costs about 5 British pounds, comes in a 10-inch pizza box, and includes doner kebab meat, nan bread, chicken tikka, pakora, onion rings, fries, some kind of slaw-type salad, and **two** kinds of sauce.

I mean, seriously. We in Buffalo have [Jim's SteakOut](http://www.jimssteakout.com/), [Mighty Taco](http://www.mightytaco.com/), and roughly 6,387 bars open until at least 2 a.m. serving beef, wings, and all kinds of so-terrible-it's-fantastic food--not to mention [Nick Tahou's](http://www.garbageplate.com/) just a short hop away. But it seems a challenge has been issued, one involving whose populace can find the grease-soaked bottom of the culinary barrel first. Let's get to work on this when I return, shall we?
