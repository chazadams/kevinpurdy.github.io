_Nine things to like about the Nickel City_

So the New York Times gave Buffalo's architectural treasures [ the feature treatment](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/arts/design/16ouro.html) on Sunday, detailing our city's beautiful contradictions and breathtaking buildings. We've got projects designed by architectural progressives who had brilliant designs on the future, while the modern city itself ... well, that's another 40 posts or so.

They also put together a pretty great [slideshow](http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/11/16/arts/20081116_OURO_SLIDESHOW_index.html) with original shots of Buffalo's prettier parts. With a smidge of work in [Picasa 3](http://picasa.google.com/), I patched those shots into a few wallpapers for those who might dig such a thing.

They're in 1680 x 1050 resolution. If requested, I can post more/different aspects and sizes. To download, right-click on the links below and choose "Save Links As" or "Save Target As," depending on your browser.
