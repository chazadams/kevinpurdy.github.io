_Colors I can never wear, but love to have on my desktop_

Over at Lifehacker, I took [a screenshot tour](http://lifehacker.com/software/screenshot-tour/a-look-at-ubuntu-710-gutsy-gibbon-rc1-311005.php) through installing the latest release from Ubuntu, 7.10, or "Gutsy Gibbon," as it's code-named. I plan to offer a few more comments here on what's still missing from the most popular/buzz-worthy Linux distribution, but overall, I'm pretty satisfied.

The official release drops Thursday, and anybody can try out the system without touching a thing on their computer by downloading a "Live CD" at [Ubuntu.com](http://www.ubuntu.com). Pop the CD in your drive, restart your computer and see what works, what doesn't, and why Digg is always [yakkin' about the 'buntu](http://www.digg.com/search?section=news&s=ubuntu).

It might not generate the same kind of heat as the next OS X release, but for open source fans, it's a twice-a-year scene, and it totally freaks us out.
