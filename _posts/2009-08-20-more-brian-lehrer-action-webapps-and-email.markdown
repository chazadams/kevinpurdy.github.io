_Not my real income/spending, but, damn, Mint.com makes self-reflection look sexy._

I'm really enjoying my guest stint on [_The Brian Lehrer Show_](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/) on WNYC, public radio for New York City. When someone, be it a host or caller, forces you to actually _talk_ about something you write about every morning in short bursts, it brings a new kind focus to it. You're forced to think about the most commonly applicable aspects of technology and productivity thinking--what I like to call the "Brother-in-Law Test" (more on that some other time).

Since I know you're crushed to have missed the segments when they originally aired, they're embedded below: Aug. 13, talking about web applications and universal capture tools, and the Aug. 20 segment, focused on email.
