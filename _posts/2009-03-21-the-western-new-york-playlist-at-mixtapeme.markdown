Want to help me round this out? I'm not a Buffalo/Rochester native, but a (nearly) 10-year veteran; this is just a quick thumbnail I dashed off. Leave your track suggestions in the comments, and I'll update the playlist embedded above. Click the upper-right corner button for a bigger view.

What am I looking for? Songs that ring true with the WNY experience; hence "Livin' on a Prayer," which I've never seen fail at a Buffalo bar or concert, and which has lyrics that, sadly, resonate pretty well. Local artists and directly-related songs are great. Nearby Canadian stuff is cool, too. But I'm just looking for a wide net to cast around the music that defines the region.

_Edit:_ Commenter Knile points out that this [came up on MetaFilter last month](http://ask.metafilter.com/114003/Songs-about-upstate-NY), unbeknownst to me (but awesomely helpful).
