This is the first post on my new, blog-driven, [Wordpress-powered](http://www.wordpress.org) personal Web site.

Basically, I'm trading the pride of being able to display the [Made with Notepad badge](http://www.thepurdman.com/old_site/images/notepad.gif), like on my [old site](http://www.thepurdman.com/old_site/), for a slicker look and ability to update without searching through 300+ lines of HTML.

Articles, projects and even multimedia stuff coming soon. I might also import some of the faux-[Merlin-Mann](http://www.5ives.com) posts from my other, [mostly abandoned blog](http://therevan.blogspot.com).

See you again real soon, I hope.
