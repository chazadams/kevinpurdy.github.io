_Wrote notes to organize thoughts on blogging. Proceeded to talk about cats, iPhone cameras, magnets._

I was lucky enough to be [interviewed](http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wxxi/news.newsmain/article/2446/0/1520186/Mixed.Media/Mixed.Media..Life.Hacking.06-24-09) at Rochester's local NPR affiliate, [WXXI](http://wxxi.org), for its weekly _Mixed Media_ segment. You can hear my 13:48 of audio fame in a [full, streaming podcast](http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wxxi/news.newsmain/article/2446/0/1520186/Mixed.Media/Mixed.Media..Life.Hacking.06-24-09); the version that plays on actual air waves (July 1 at about 3:44pm, methinks?) will be much shorter. It's mostly a soft, slightly rambling introduction to [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com), as well as some honest answers about what it's like to blog for a living.

I tend to do two things when I'm talking on the spot: use many more "um" verbal placeholders than I would in casual conversation, and, to put it nicely, venture off the path with my answers to straightforward questions. The latter is somewhat inherent to how I think, but the former is something I could use some help and training on. If I find great resources online, I'll share 'em; if you've got any tips for a neophyte interviewee, let me know with a comment.
