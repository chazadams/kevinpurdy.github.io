It also partially explains why I haven't had a post up here in a while, because I'm doing my own life-hacking and working to fit all my schedules together.

I'm looking at the upcoming weekend as one of the last before holiday matters (Pop-singer-performs-Christmas-standards discs are already on sale!), work demands and yet another wedding leave me heavily obligated. I'm thinking it's time crack out [the ol' GTD](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-8734790-9909609?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1192047696&sr=8-1) again and commit to it.
