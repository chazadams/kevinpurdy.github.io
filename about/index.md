There are already pages about [my work](/projects/index.html) and [contacting me](/contact/index.html). This is more about me (me, me).

So far:

+ Born and raised in [Baldwinsville, NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwinsville), a suburb of Syracuse (though technically [Lysander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander,_New_York), if you're taking a census).

+ Educated (as best they could try) by the [University at Buffalo](http://buffalo.edu), where I predominantly wrote for [_The Spectrum_](http://ubspectrum.com).

+ Worked as something of a long-term intern/temp at [_The Buffalo News_](http://buffalonews.com), then the [_Sandusky Register_](http://sanduskyregister.com), then the [_Niagara Gazette_](http://niagara-gazette.com) and its affiliated local papers.

+ I made the jump from print to web when [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org) responded to my email and hired me on at [_Lifehacker_](http://lifehacker.com).
