I am, primarily, a writer. You can see my [portfolio of recent work at Contently](http://kevinpurdy.contently.com). Need a writer? [Email me](/contact/index.html).

I write most often about technology, but also [obsessive video game modders](http://the-magazine.org/23/the-everending-story#.UnPEU6pDt2M), [secretive moneyed social clubs](http://www.buffalospree.com/Buffalo-Spree/May-2013/Leaders-of-the-Pack-On-the-trail-of-Buffalos-most-elusive-organization), [caffeine](http://lifehacker.com/5585217/what-caffeine-actually-does-to-your-brain), and other nerdy things.

I'm getting better at podcasts. I co-host [In Beta](http://5by5.tv/inbeta), a weekly podcast with [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org). Every so often, I get to do another episode of [In Pod Form](http://inpodform.com) with [Phil Dzikiy](http://phildzikiy.com).

I've launched a few events and projects in Buffalo. Namely: the annual [TEDxBuffalo](http://tedxbuffalo.com) conference, [CoworkBuffalo](http://coworkbuffalo.com) in downtown Buffalo, and the off-the-cuff [Ignite Buffalo](http://ignitebuffalo.com) talk session.
