====================

The homepage of Kevin Purdy. A Jekyll site with quite a few tweaks. Details at [the Colophon](http://thepurdman.com/colophon-for-a-new-site/).

By all means, tell me about typos, style points, glitches in Internet Explorer, and other issues at (where else?) the [issues section](https://github.com/kevinpurdy/kevinpurdy.github.io/issues).

Please to enjoy.
